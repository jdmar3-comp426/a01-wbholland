    <h1>The Phaeacian Algorithm</h1>
    <p>The Greek computer scientist Harry Foundalis earned his PhD developing a cognitive architecture called Phaeco,
        aimed at completing pattern identification, learning, and categorization tasks.</p>
    <p>The name Phaeco refers to Homer's Odyssey, wherein the Phaeacians build a ship for Odysseus that Foundalis
        thought reminiscent of an artificial intelligence:</p>
    <div>
        <p>“Your country, tell me what it’s called, your people and your city;<br>
            then let our ships design their course, and bring you safely homeward.<br>
            Phaeacian ships do not have men to steer them on their courses;<br>
            they lack the rudders you may see in ships of other nations;<br>
            but on their own they guess the thoughts and wishes of their makers;<br>
            they know all countries of the world, their cities, and their meadows;<br>
            they travel swiftly like the wind that blows o’er seas and oceans,<br>
            avoiding storms and cloudy skies, so they are not in danger<br>
            of sailing off their course to founder, sink, and slowly vanish.”</p>

    <p>Specifically, Phaeco is designed to solve Bongard problems, a type of test invented by Soviet computer scientist
        Mikhail Bongard that involves recognizing the rule that separates two sets of images.</p>
    <p>To get a better idea of what a Bongard problem is, try solving the following examples:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="problem-1">Stained Glass Windows</a></li>
        <li><a href="problem-2">Hullabaloo</a></li>
        <li><a href="problem-3">SOJLZIT</a></li>
    </ol>
