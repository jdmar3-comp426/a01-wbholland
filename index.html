    <h1>The Phaeacian Algorithm</h1>
    <p>The Greek computer scientist Harry Foundalis earned his PhD developing a cognitive architecture called Phaeaco, aimed at performing pattern identification, learning, and categorization tasks.</p>
    <p>The name Phaeaco refers to Homer's Odyssey, wherein the Phaeacians build a ship for Odysseus that Foundalis thought reminiscent of an artificial intelligence:</p>
    <div class="text-and-content">
        <div class="poem">
            <p>“Your country, tell me what it’s called, your people and your city;<br> then let our ships design their course, and bring you safely homeward.<br> Phaeacian ships do not have men to steer them on their courses;
                <br> they lack the rudders you may see in ships of other nations;<br> but on their own they guess the thoughts and wishes of their makers;
                <br> they know all countries of the world, their cities, and their meadows;<br> they travel swiftly like the wind that blows o’er seas and oceans,
                <br> avoiding storms and cloudy skies, so they are not in danger<br> of sailing off their course to founder, sink, and slowly vanish.”</p>

    <p>Specifically, Phaeaco is designed to solve Bongard problems, a type of test invented by Soviet computer scientist Mikhail Bongard that requires recognizing the rule that separates two sets of images.</p>
    <p>To get a better idea of what a Bongard problem is, try solving the following examples:</p>

        </li>
